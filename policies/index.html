    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      Rails Camp Sydney is organised under the umbrella of Ruby Australia and follows its Code of Conduct:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>MATZ IS NICE, AND WE ARE NICE.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same way that Matz has written Ruby with a focus on developer happiness, we are focused
      on community happiness. The Australian Ruby community is full of wonderful people from a diverse
      range of backgrounds, and we want to ensure it remains a welcoming and safe environment to all
      who wish to be a part of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever we come together as a community, our shared spaces are opportunities to showcase the
      best of what we can be. We are there to support our peers - to build each other up, to accept
      each other for who they are, and to encourage each other to become the people they want to be.
    </p>

    <p>
      With that in mind, if you are present at Rails Camp, whether as an attendee, organiser,
      sponsor or speaker, we take it as given that you agree to follow this code of conduct:
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ruby Australia organisation is dedicated to providing harassment-free experiences at events
      and conferences for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability,
      physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or age. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.
    </p>

    <p>
      All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different
      backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in any circumstance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members of the community. Be respectful towards
      others. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at Rails Camp.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyone violating these rules at events may be asked to leave the event without a refund at the sole
      discretion of the organisers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you or someone else is subject to harassment, or you have a concern, please contact the event
      organisers Leonard Garvey, James Sadler, or member of the Ruby Australia committee. The camp organisers
      will be clearly identified at the start of the camp
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ruby community is a welcoming and friendly place â€“ thank you for being a part of it.
    </p>

    <h2>Anti-Harassment Policy</h2>
    <p>
      The Rails Camp organisers and Ruby Australia are dedicated to providing a harassment-free Rails Camp experience for everyone, regardless
      of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
      tolerate harassment of camp participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
      for any camp venue, including talks or activities. Camp participants violating these rules may be sanctioned
      or expelled from the camp without a refund at the discretion of the camp organisers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
      appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
      following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate
      physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
      expected to comply immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the camp organizers may take any action they deem
      appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the camp with no refund. If you are
      being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
      a member of camp organisers or camp staff immediately. Rails Camp organisers and camp staff will be
      clearly identified at the start of the camp.
    </p>

    <p>
      We expect participants to follow these rules at the camp venue and camp-related activies.
